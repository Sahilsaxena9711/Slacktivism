                <b>Slacklining</b> refers to the act of walking, running or balancing along a suspended length of flat
                webbing that is tensioned between two anchors. Slacklining is similar to slack rope walking and
                tightrope walking. Slacklines differ from tightwires and tightropes in the type of material used and the
                amount of tension applied during use. Slacklines are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or
                tightwires in order to create a dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long and narrow
                trampoline. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various
                circumstances.
                <br />
                <br />
                Urbanlining or urban slacklining combines all the different styles of slacklining. It is practiced in
                urban areas, for example in city parks and on the streets. Most urban slackliners prefer wide 2-inch (5
                cm) lines for tricklining on the streets, but some may use narrow (5⁄8 or 1 inch, 1.6 or 2.5 cm) lines
                for longline purposes or for waterlining. Also see the other sections of slackline styles below.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another type of urbanlining is streetlining, which combines street workout power moves with the
                slackline's dynamic, shaky, bouncy feeling. The main focus are static handstands, super splits—hands and
                feet together, planche, front lever, back lever, one arm handstand and other interesting extreme moves
                that are evolving in street workout culture.One type of urbanlining is timelining, where one tries to
                stay on a slackline for as long as possible without falling down. This takes tremendous concentration
                and focus of will, and is a great endurance training for postural muscles.

                Rodeo slacklining is the art and practice of cultivating balance on a piece of rope or webbing draped
                slack between two anchor points, typically about 15 to 30 feet (455 to 915 cm) apart and 2 to 3 feet (60
                to 90 cm) off the ground in the center. This type of very "slack" slackline provides a wide array of
                opportunities for both swinging and static maneuvers. A rodeo line has no tension in it, while both
                traditional slacklines and tightropes are tensioned. This slackness in the rope or webbing allows it to
                swing at large amplitudes and adds a different dynamic. This form of slacklining first came into
                popularity in 1999, through a group of students from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. It was first
                written about on a website called the "Vultures Peak Center for Freestyle and Rodeo Slackline Research"
                in 2004. The article "Old Revolution—New Recognition - 3-10-04" describes these early developments in
                detail.
